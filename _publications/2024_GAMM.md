## Abstract

> This paper provides an overview of current approaches for solving inverse problems in imaging using variational methods and machine learning. A special focus lies on point estimators and their robustness against adversarial perturbations. In this context results of numerical experiments for a one-dimensional toy problem are provided, showing the robustness of different approaches and empirically verifying theoretical guarantees. Another focus of this review is the exploration of the subspace of data-consistent solutions through explicit guidance to satisfy specific semantic or textural properties.
